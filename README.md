# Portkey Wallet Assets Info

## Overview

Portkey Wallet token repository is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.

[Portkey Wallet](https://portkey.finance/) uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects.

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token_.

## How to add token

If you want to add a new Token, please fork the repository first and then submit a pull request with your changes. Please note that you must create a directory named "\<Token symbol\> / info" in the blockchains directory and upload the Token information to that directory. The file format should be info.json and logo.png.

## Disclaimer

Portkey Wallet team allows anyone to submit new assets to this repository. However, this does not mean that we are in direct partnership with all of the projects.

Portkey Wallet team will reject projects that are deemed as scam or fraudulent after careful review.
Portkey Wallet team reserves the right to change the terms of asset submissions at any time due to changing market conditions, risk of fraud, or any other factors we deem relevant.

Additionally, spam-like behavior, including but not limited to mass distribution of tokens to random addresses will result in the asset being flagged as spam and possible removal from the repository.
